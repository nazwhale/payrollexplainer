# UK Payroll Explainer

An interactive web application that explains and compares different methods for calculating Directors' National Insurance in the UK.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This tool helps payroll professionals, accountants, and company directors understand the difference between the **Standard (annual)** and **Alternative** methods for calculating Directors' National Insurance contributions.

### The "Bucket vs Drip-feed" Analogy

- **Standard (annual) method** = *One big bucket*: NI is calculated annually, creating sudden spikes when cumulative pay exceeds thresholds
- **Alternative method** = *Drip-feed*: NI is calculated per pay period like regular employees, with a year-end true-up
- **Employees (non-directors)** = *Always drip-feed*, no balancing step

## âœ¨ Features

- **Interactive Salary Slider** (Â£5k â†’ Â£200k)
- **Pay Frequency Selector** (monthly/weekly)
- **Director Start Date Picker** (handles mid-year appointments)
- **Per-pay-run NI Chart** - Shows the "spike vs smooth" contrast
- **Cumulative NI Chart** - Proves totals end up identical while cash-flow differs
- **Real-time Calculations** - Updates instantly as you adjust parameters
- **Copy Explanation** - Generate ready-to-use explanations for stakeholders

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

## ðŸ“Š How It Works

The application calculates National Insurance using the 2025/26 thresholds:
- **Primary Threshold (PT)**: Â£12,570 annually
- **Upper Earnings Limit (UEL)**: Â£50,270 annually

### Calculation Methods

1. **Standard (Annual) Method**: Waits until cumulative salary exceeds the annual PT before NI starts
2. **Alternative Method**: Calculates NI per pay period, then applies a year-end balancing charge
3. **Employee Baseline**: Regular employee calculation for comparison

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Philosophy

- **Visual-first learning** - Charts tell the story better than text
- **Instant feedback** - Real-time updates as you adjust parameters
- **Mobile-friendly** - Responsive design works on all devices
- **Accessible** - WCAG compliant with proper contrast and keyboard navigation
